# WIP - Monzo to You Need a Budget automatic transaction updating

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/MobliMic/monzo-to-ynab)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/MobliMic/monzo-to-ynab)

The purpose of this project is to make it easy for me to pull transactions from my monzo account into YNAB. Its very rough as I'm using it as an opportunity to learn go at the same time.

Use at your own risk!
